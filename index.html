  <h2>Our Story</h2>

  <p>Pat grew up in the city. It's a part of his life he doesn't have much ties to anymore. Once Pat disovered nature he knew the city just wasn't for him. He spent most of his youg adult life as a fisherman in Alaska and traveled the country in the off season. Nowadays Pat can be found living in the most remote areas. A log cabin here, a log cabin there. Pat discovered youtube one day while doing an internet search at his local internet cafe and thought he could share some of his extensive knowledge about the outdoors, fishing, and natural ecosystems. His Youtube vlog about The Great Outdoors and healthy ecosystems made him a Youtube Star and saw a little bit of extra money coming in. He decided to put that extra money he was getting into a small business.  Pat was always fascinated by natural phenomenon. He always talked about the circle of life and thought, "when do we ever give back to those creatures that give so much to us. Combining his love for sweets and his passion for healthy ecosystems, Pat developed a recipe for a coffee-time confection called Salmon Cookies. These cookies made into the shape of a salmon and are suitable for both humans and salmon to enjoy. Salmon Cookies is a not-for-profit company that wants to give back, not only back to the community, but our ecosystems as well. That's why for every Salmon Cookie you buy, 80% of all profits go towards charities like the Wildlife Conservation Society. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit.

  <p>Above you'll see a picture of the Choo-Choo the Salmon himself. The salmon that inspired Pat to start the whole company. This salmon is a special type of salmon called a Chinook salmon and Pat came accross it one day while visiting the Ballard Locks. The fish practically jumped out at him and was the one who inspired him to start the company. Choo-Cho lives a reserved life in Pat's own personal pond.</p>
